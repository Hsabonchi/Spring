* JPA  Operations that modify database content, such as a store, update, and delete should only be performed within an active transaction.
  	---
  - `entityManager.getTransaction().begin();` | `entityManager.getTransaction().commit();`| `entityManagerFactory.close();`

  A simple Persistent class should follow some rules
  ----
* A no-arg constructor: It is recommended that you have a default constructor at least package visibility so that hibernate can create the   instance of the Persistent class by newInstance() method.
* Provide an identifier property: It is better to assign an attribute as id. This attribute behaves as a primary key in a database.
* Declare getter and setter methods: The Hibernate recognizes the method by getter and setter method names by default.
* Prefer non-final class: Hibernate uses the concept of proxies, that depends on the persistent class. The application programmer will not be able to use proxies for lazy association fetching.


---
   The relationships between Entity classes are as follows:

- @ManyToOne Relation
- @OneToMany Relation
- @OneToOne Relation
- @ManyToMany Relation

- @OneToMany Relation:In a one-to-many relationship between Table A and Table B, each row in Table A is linked to 0, 1 or many rows in Table B.
   > In a One-to-Many/Many-to-One relationship, the owning side is usually defined on the â€˜many' side of the relationship. It's usually the side which owns the     foreign key.The @JoinColumn annotation defines that actual physical mapping on the owning side.
   >  the value of mappedBy is the name of the association-mapping attribute on the owning side



- @ Many-To-One relation between entities: Where one entity (column or set of columns) is/are referenced with another entity (column or set of columns) which contain unique values. In relational databases these relations are applicable by using foreign key/primary key between tables.








Common Errors
---
 * hibernate_sequence  does not exist. 
    * [error performing isolated work](https://coderanch.com/t/487173/databases/hibernate-sequence-exist).
 * PK mappmed to FK [@JoinColumn](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11938253/whats-the-difference-between-joincolumn-and-mappedby-when-using-a-jpa-onetoma)
 * Use of @OneToMany or @ManyToMany targeting an unmapped class `You forgot the @Entity annotation on the ***** class.`
